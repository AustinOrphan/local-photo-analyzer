# 🗺️ Local Photo Analyzer Roadmap

## Vision Statement

Create a secure, privacy-first photo organization system that uses local AI to intelligently analyze, rename, tag, and organize photos while maintaining complete data privacy. The system will use date-based primary organization with symbolic links for categorical access.

## Core Principles

- **Privacy First**: All processing happens locally - no cloud API calls
- **AI-Powered**: Local LLM integration for intelligent photo analysis
- **Smart Organization**: Date-based primary structure with tag-based symbolic links
- **User Control**: Manual override capabilities for AI decisions
- **Extensible**: Plugin architecture for future enhancements

## Technical Architecture

### Technology Stack
- **Language**: Python 3.9+
- **Local LLM Options**:
  - Ollama with LLaVA for vision-language understanding
  - CLIP for image-text matching and embeddings
  - Alternative: MiniGPT-4 for smaller deployments
- **Database**: SQLite (initial) / PostgreSQL (advanced)
- **Image Processing**: Pillow, OpenCV
- **Web Framework**: FastAPI for API, React for frontend
- **CLI**: Click for command-line interface
